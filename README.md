# ADS1: Cervical Cancer Analysis

## Background

Cervical cancer is the fourth most prevalent cancer among women globally. However, research has shown that preventative measures like HPV vaccines can reduce the risk of developing cervical cancer. Periodic screening through Pap smear tests has also helped to detect abnormal cells before they could develop into cervical cancer. Because of socioeconomic limitations, not all women have access to preventative measures like HPV vaccines ([Goal 3: Maximize Access to HPV Vaccination Services](https://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/advisory/pcp/annualreports/hpv/Part3Goal3.htm#:~:text=While%20HPV%20vaccines%20are%20among,law's%20requirements%20for%20vaccine%20coverage.)). According to the National Institute of Health, low- and middle-income countries face the brunt of HPV-related cancer cases, with more than 90% of these cases resulting in cervical cancer ([Part 4: Increasing Global HPV Vaccination](https://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/advisory/pcp/annualreports/hpv/Part4.htm)). Physicians usually recommend scheduling a Pap smear test every few years ([Pap smear - Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pap-smear/about/pac-20394841)). Nevertheless, many women do not receive proper screening due to a lack of health literacy or insufficient healthcare systems ([Women’s perception of barriers and facilitators of cervical cancer Pap smear screening: a qualitative study | BMJ Open](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/14/1/e072954)). Cervical cancer is highly treatable if caught in the early stages of development ([Cervical Cancer: Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis & Treatment](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12216-cervical-cancer)). If national cancer screening programs, HPV vaccines, and Pap smear tests prove to be effective measures in preventing severe stages of cervical cancer, governments and various health organizations should consider investing in these programs/precautions.

## Overview

The goal of this research project was to compare the effects of preventative measures like HPV vaccines versus screening measures like Pap smear tests on cervical cancer incidence/mortality rates within the United States. I split my research project into five different sections: collecting datasets (1), cleaning/preprocessing my datasets (2), adding the cleaned datasets into a relational database (3), performing data analysis (4), and compiling a report on my findings (5). I have included each step of my project in this GitHub repository, as well as the datasets I used for my analysis. Likely, the results of my analysis are not entirely accurate, so my conclusions should be considered carefully within the scope of this project.
